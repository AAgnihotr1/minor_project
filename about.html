            <h2>About Jabalpur</h2>
            <p>Jabalpur, known as the "Sanskardhani" of Madhya Pradesh, is a city with a rich history and cultural heritage. Located on the banks of the holy Narmada River, Jabalpur is famous for its marble rocks at Bhedaghat and the Dhuandhar Falls.</p>
            <p>It is the 3rd-largest urban agglomeration of the state and the 38th-largest of the country. Jabalpur is the administrative headquarters of the Jabalpur district and the 
                Jabalpur division. It is the judicial capital of Madhya Pradesh with Madhya Pradesh High Court being located in the city.  </p>
            <P>Jabalpur was an important centre of power during the rule of the Gond kings of Garha-Mandla.[14] The ruler of Garha-Mandla, Madan Shah, (1138â€“1157) built a watchtower and a small hilltop fort at Madan Mahal, 
                an area in Jabalpur. In the 1500s, the Gond king, Sangram Shah held Singorgarh fort. Rani Durgawati was a princess of the Chandela Dynasty who was married to Dalpat Shah of the Gond dynasty. She was well aware of the importance of water conservation, and hence she built more than 85 ponds in Jabalpur, mainly in Ranital, Haathital, Madhatal and Hanumantal.[15]
</P> 
            <p>The city has a tropical savanna climate and is home to institutions of national importance like IIITDM Jabalpur and Tropical Forest Research Institute.</p>
